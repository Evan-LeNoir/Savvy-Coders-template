Here's a simple overview and what will be covered in this readme:

3. Inputing critial maintaince data and their time interavals.

## Get Started

**First thing's first:** Be sure to select (or manually set) your vehicel's year, make then model (subtrims unnecessary unless your trim has an optional engine).

**Second:** For some vehicles, it is important to select which grade of fuel it recommends or in some extreme cases requires. This data will help the syste solve for your mileage as well as operation costs.

**Lastly (optional):** Input the maintaince data that is specific for this vehicle. This can be found in your owners manual's *index* section. If you have a second-hand vehicle and lack the owners manual, try contacting a dealer or the manufacturer directly to obtain this information.
